            More information about why we collect the information we do is available
            on the registration form. It is also summarized below: 
            - Name: We need
            your name to make sure you are a real person and in some cases may need it
            to process payments 
            - Display Name: We know in some circumstances your
            legal name may not accurately reflect your intentions on the platform (for
            example if you are procuring services on behalf of a business) so we allow
            you to choose a display name if you feel that would be more appropriate. 
            - Phone Number: We use the phone number as another safety measure (in
            addtion to legal name) and in the future may share it with service
            providers you contact on the platform so that they can contact you
            regarding your request(s). 
            - Location: We collect this information so that
            we can suggest services that might be relevant to you and so that service
            providers can determine if they provide the requested services in your
            area. 
            - Profile Image: This helps make everything more personal. Your
            profile image may be displayed in when you provide feedback on the
            platform (such as reviews) or when you contact a provider.
